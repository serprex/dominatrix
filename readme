dominatrix is an experiment in code reuse for implementing a browser

JS via node's vm module
HTML parsing via parse5
CSS parsing via css

All that's missing is rendering these pieces together. Roadmap:
1 Implement basic positional logic & text rendering
2 Decompose most HTML elements into styled divs (issue: canvas)
3 Implement UI as an html page that displays content through an iframe
4 Flesh out CSS rendering until sites rendered acceptably
5 Improve UI

#3 should likely be split as the executable,
the rest of the code a general library for HTML UIs

Currently thinking of using a gl/glfw/freetype stack,
was hoisting via ffi; leaning towards node glue in C as FreeType's API is terrible (exposed struct layout)
